# Autonomous Agents Template

A template repository for creating autonomous AI agents using Claude. This template provides scripts and structure for task-based autonomous agent workflows.

## Features

- 🤖 Autonomous task execution with Claude
- 📋 Issue and plan management system with todo tracking
- 🎨 Beautiful formatted output with progress tracking
- 🔄 Single task or continuous execution modes
- 📝 Structured issue and plan templates

## Prerequisites

- [Claude CLI](https://claude.ai/code) installed and configured
- Bash shell (macOS/Linux)
- `jq` for JSON parsing (install with `brew install jq` or `apt-get install jq`)

## Quick Start

1. **Clone this template**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd autonomous-agents-template
   ```

2. **Create your first issue**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/create-issue.sh "Build a REST API for user management"
   ```

3. **Run the agent**
   ```bash
   # Run a single task
   ./scripts/run-agent.sh

   # Run all tasks continuously
   ./scripts/run-agent.sh --auto
   ```

## Bootstrapping from a Master Plan

When you have a comprehensive plan or specification document, you can bootstrap your entire project structure:

### 1. **Create Master Plan**
First, create a detailed plan document:
```bash
echo "Your comprehensive project plan..." > master-plan.md
```

### 2. **Create Bootstrap Issue**
```bash
./scripts/create-issue.sh "Bootstrap Project from Master Plan"
```

### 3. **Edit the Bootstrap Issue**
Edit the created issue to instruct Claude to decompose your master plan:

```markdown
# Issue X: Bootstrap Project from Master Plan

## Requirement
Read the `master-plan.md` file and decompose it into structured issues following our patterns. Create separate issues for each major component or phase.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Analyze master plan and identify major implementation phases
- [ ] Create individual issues for each phase using create-issue.sh
- [ ] Populate each issue with specific requirements from the master plan
- [ ] Create corresponding detailed implementation plans
- [ ] Update todo.md with all new tasks
- [ ] Ensure proper sequencing and dependencies

## Technical Details
Use the existing issue/plan structure. Each issue should be self-contained but reference related issues where appropriate.

## Resources
- master-plan.md - The comprehensive project specification
```

### 4. **Run the Agent**
```bash
./scripts/run-agent.sh
```

Claude will read your master plan and automatically:
- Break it down into logical issues
- Create detailed implementation plans
- Set up the entire project structure
- Prepare everything for autonomous execution

### 5. **Execute the Generated Issues**
Once bootstrapping is complete:
```bash
# Review the generated issues and plans
ls issues/
ls plans/

# Run all issues autonomously
./scripts/run-agent.sh --auto
```

This bootstrapping approach is perfect for:
- Large projects with detailed specifications
- Converting existing documentation into actionable tasks
- Migrating from other project management systems
- Setting up complex multi-phase implementations

```

## Scripts

### `run-agent.sh`
The main script that runs Claude on your tasks.

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/run-agent.sh [--auto]
```

**Options:**
- `--auto`: Run all pending issues continuously
- Without flags: Run the next pending issue only

### `create-issue.sh`
Creates a new issue file with corresponding plan and adds it to todo.md.

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/create-issue.sh [--editor] "Issue title"
```

**Options:**
- `--editor`: Open the created issue in your $EDITOR

**Example:**
```bash
./scripts/create-issue.sh --editor "Implement authentication system"
```

### `complete-issue.sh`
Manually mark an issue as complete (useful if an issue was completed outside the agent).

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/complete-issue.sh <issue_number>"
```

**Example:**
```bash
./scripts/complete-issue.sh 3
```

## Issue and Plan Format

### Issues
Issues are markdown files in the `issues/` directory:

```markdown
# Issue N: Title

## Requirement
[Main requirement or problem to solve]

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Specific criterion 1
- [ ] Specific criterion 2

## Technical Details
[Technical constraints or notes]

## Resources
[Documentation or references]
```

### Plans
Each issue has a corresponding plan in the `plans/` directory:

```markdown
# Plan for Issue N: Title

## Implementation Plan
### Phase 1: Setup
- [ ] Initial tasks

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
- [ ] Main implementation tasks

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Testing tasks

## Technical Approach
[Architecture decisions]

## Potential Challenges
[Anticipated issues]
```

## Customization

### Claude Instructions
Create a `CLAUDE.md` file in the root directory to provide project-specific instructions:

```markdown
# Project Context
- Architecture: [Your architecture]
- Tech stack: [Your technologies]
- Conventions: [Your coding standards]

# Special Instructions
[Any specific guidelines for the agent]
```

### Environment Variables
- `AUTO_COMMIT`: Set to "true" to auto-commit after each issue completion (requires git)
- `EDITOR`: Your preferred text editor for the --editor flag

## Examples

### Example 1: Web Development Project
```bash
# Create issues for a web app
./scripts/create-issue.sh "Set up Express.js server with TypeScript"
./scripts/create-issue.sh "Create user authentication endpoints"
./scripts/create-issue.sh "Add PostgreSQL database integration"

# Run all issues
./scripts/run-agent.sh --auto
```

### Example 2: Data Processing Pipeline
```bash
# Create data pipeline issues
./scripts/create-issue.sh "Parse CSV files from input directory"
./scripts/create-issue.sh "Transform data according to schema"
./scripts/create-issue.sh "Export results to JSON format"

# Run issues one by one with review
./scripts/run-agent.sh
# Review results...
./scripts/run-agent.sh
# Review results...
./scripts/run-agent.sh
```

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Issue Definitions**: Be specific about requirements and acceptance criteria
2. **Detailed Plans**: Create comprehensive implementation plans
3. **Incremental Issues**: Break large projects into smaller, testable issues
3. **Context Matters**: Include relevant project context in CLAUDE.md
4. **Review Output**: In non-auto mode, review agent output before proceeding
5. **Version Control**: Commit your issues, plans, and todo.md for tracking

## Troubleshooting

**"claude: command not found"**
- Install Claude CLI from https://claude.ai/code

**"jq: command not found"**
- macOS: `brew install jq`
- Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install jq`
- Other: See https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/

**Issue not being marked complete**
- Check that the agent successfully completed the issue
- Use `./scripts/complete-issue.sh N` to manually mark complete
